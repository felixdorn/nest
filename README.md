Nest is a simple pseudo-programming language for defining repeatable and non-repeatable events in time.

Here are a couple examples of the syntax:

```
"brush my teeth" everyday at 7:00 for 3 minutes
```

```
"dentist and chill" tomorrow at 17:30 for an hour
```

```
"workout" every monday, saturday and sunday at 2 for 1h until 15/6/2021
```

Nest outputs a list of time periods with their labels.

Here's an example output for `"something" once 1/1/2021 from 15:00 to 16:00`:

```php
[
    "label"       => "something",
    "now"         => "2021-01-01 00:00:00",
    "occurrences" => [
        "2021-01-01 15:00:00" => "2021-01-01 16:00:00"
    ]
]
```

# Features

* Natural syntax
* Labeling
* Error reporting
* Fast (enough)

## Reproducibility

The same code could lead to a completely different output based on the current time.

Therefore, when storing Nest code, you should also store the current time if reproducibility is an issue for you (it
probably is).

## Keywords

### Every

Every indicates that an event is repeated it takes as a parameter one or many weekdays.

```
every monday and saturday
```

See how lists work [here](#lists).

You may use the shorthand `everyday` that compiles to every day of the week

```
everyday at 6:30
```

You may also use the shorthand `weekend` that compiles to `saturday and sunday`

```
every weekend
```

### For

For indicates how long an event lasts.

```
for one hour
```

Here's a guide on [How you can quantify time in Nest](#quantifying-time)

Here's a list of all the time measurement units you may use:

* minute
* hour
* day
* week

You may pluralize them to keep the sentence grammatically correct but the compiler won't pick up on it if you don't.

Shorthands such as `1h` (1 hour) are also allowed.

Here's a list of all available shorthands:

* m: minute
* min: minute
* h: hour
* d: day
* w: week

## Between

Between constrains the event between two dates.

```
between 12/04/2021 and 12/12/2021
```

If you wish to constrain an event between a time range, use [from](#from--to-).

## From ... to ...

From constrains the event between a time range.

```
from 22:00 to 23:05
```

## Until

Until is a shorthand for the [between](#between) keyword.

```
until 12/12/2021
```

The start date is the current time.

## At

At defines at which time an event starts. It is often used in combination with `for` that sets the duration of the event.

```
at 6 for an hour
```

## Lists

A list contains one or many literals such as `monday` or `1:00` and these are separated with commas or the word `and`.

```
monday, saturday and sunday
1:00,16:00
tuesday and sunday, monday
monday, saturday, sunday
``` 

## Quantifying Time

You can use any number from `one` to a `sixty` in literal form.

```
for fifty-five minutes
```

You can use any non-negative integer such as `1` or `42`.

```
for 10 hours
```

To represent one unit of time, you may use a simpler form:

```
for an hour
for a day
```

> The compiler doesn't make a difference if you write `a` or `an` so `for a hour` still represents `1 hour` even though it is grammatically incorrect.

## API
 
### Installation

If you don't have composer, you can download it [here](https://getcomposer.org/download).

```php
composer require felixdorn/nest
```

### Usage

```php
\Felix\Nest\Nest::compile(
    'everyday for an hour at 12',
    \Carbon\CarbonPeriod::create(
        \Carbon\Carbon::now(),
        \Carbon\Carbon::now()->addWeek()
    )
    # Optionally, you can also pass the current time as a third parameter.
    # \Carbon\Carbon::now()
)
```

If your event does not have fixed boundaries set using `between ... and ...` or `until ...`, it repeats indefinitely.
Therefore, you need to set manual boundaries at compile-time hence the second `CarbonPeriod` parameter. You can omit it
if you know that your event has fixed boundaries.
